# Goalign: toolkit and api for alignment manipulation

## Commands

### subseq
This command takes a sub-alignment (slice) from the input alignment.

It takes an alignment and extracts sub-sequences from it, given
a start position (0-based inclusive) and a length.
If the length is after the end of the alignment, will stop at the 
end of the alignment.

(start,length) can be specified on the alignment coordinate system (default) 
or on a given sequence coordinate system without gaps (`--ref-seq`). It allows 
to extract sub alignment by just knowing coordinates on a given unaligned sequence.


For example:
```
goalign subseq -p -i al.phy -s 9 -l 10
```

This will extract a sub-alignment going from 10th position of the alignemnt, with a length of 10.

The output format is the same than input format.

If `--ref-seq <name>` is specified, then the coordinates are specified on the given sequence
coordinate system without considering gaps.

For example:

If al.fa is:
```
>s1
--ACG--AT-GC
>s2
GGACGTTATCGC
```

Then:
```
goalign subseq -i al.fa -s 0 -l 4 --ref-seq s1
````

will output:

```
>s1
ACG--A
>s2
ACGTTA
```

`--ref-seq` is currently not not compatible with `--step`


Sliding window:
---------------

If `--step` is given and > 0, then Several sub-alignments will be produced,
and corresponding to all alignments in windows of sizes -l, and with starts:
[start, start+step, ..., end-length].

Example with an alignment al.phy of size 10 (0123456789)

```
goalign subseq -i al.phy -s 0 -l 5 --step 1
```
will produce alignments with positions:

```
01234
 12345
  23456
   34567
    45678
     56789
```

Warning: If output is stdout, it works only if input format is Phylip, because 
it is possible to split alignments afterwards (with `goalign divide` for example).

`--step` is currently not compatible with `--ref-seq`.

Several alignments:
------------------

If several alignments are present in the input file and the output is a file (not stdout or -) , then :

* First alignment, first subalignment: results will be placed in the given file
  (ex out.fasta)
* First alignment, other subalignments (sliding windows): results will be placed
  in file with the given name with `_sub<i>` suffix (ex: `out_sub1.fasta`, `out_sub2.fasta`, etc.)
* Other alignments, first subalignment: results will be placed in the given file
  with `_al<i>` suffix (ex `out_al1.fasta`, `out_al2.fasta`, etc.)
* Other alignments, other subalignments: results will be placed in the given file
  with `_al<i>` and `_sub<i>` suffixes (ex `out_al1_sub1.fasta`, `out_al1_sub2.fasta`, etc.)

#### Usage
```
Usage:
  goalign subseq [flags]
  
Flags:
  -l, --length int      Length of the sub alignment (default 10)
  -o, --output string   Alignment output file (default "stdout")
  -s, --start int       Start position
      --step int        Step: If > 0, then will generate several alignments, 
                        for each window of length l, with starts: 
                        [start,start+step, ..., end-l]*

Global Flags:
  -i, --align string   Alignment input file (default "stdin")
  -p, --phylip         Alignment is in phylip? False=Fasta
  --input-strict       Strict phylip input format (only used with -p)
  --output-strict      Strict phylip output format  (only used with -p)
```

#### Examples

* Generating a random alignment and taking a sub-alignment of length 10 from position 5:
```
goalign random -n 4 --seed 10 -l 100 | goalign subseq -l 10 -s 5
```

It should give the following alignment:
```
>Seq0000
ATTTGCCGTA
>Seq0001
GACCTAAGTA
>Seq0002
CGCGGGCGGA
>Seq0003
GAGGCTTTAT
```
