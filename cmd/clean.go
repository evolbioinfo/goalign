	Short: "Removes gap sites",
	Long: `Removes sites constituted of gaps

Removes alignments sites constitued of >= cutoff gap sites.

Exception for a cutoff of 0: removes sites constitued of > 0 gap sites.

Examples:
- With a cutoff of 0.5: a site with 5 gaps over 10 sequences will be removed;
- With a cutoff of 0.5: a site with 4 gaps over 10 sequences will not be removed;
- With a cutoff of 0.0 a site with 1 gap over 10 sequences will be removed.

If cutoff is <0 or >1, it will be considered as 0, which means that every site with at least 1 gap
will be removed.
